# CountryLists
This repository contains:
- up-to-date lists of member countries in various clubs (e.g., the EU, OECD, ASEAN, etc.)
- Python program files that you can use automatically fetch updated lists from official websites
- conversion files (called IsoToXX) which allow you to standardise your datasets so that they use ISO codes. 

# Recommendation for multi-country projects
Any multi-country project is much simplified by using ISO codes for all stages of analysis. Only convert the ISO codes to country names in the language of your choice once your analysis is complete, and you wish to start creating charts and tables for your report or presentation.

If you do not do this, it is remarkably easy to make mistakes in your analysis because in one place you've called it "UK" and in another "United Kingdom" or in one place "Macao" and in another "Macau".

# Possible future additions
